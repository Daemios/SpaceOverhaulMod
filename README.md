# SpaceOverhaulMod
Space Engineers overhaul that makes progression between stellar bodies and the gathering of materials the main focus of the game. 

Core concepts and goals:
- Most tech blocks and tools have several tiers available to add additional functionality, as well as speed/power/etc.
- Various tedious mining operations can be automated with expensive but passive resource generating blocks available for static grids.
- Most ores aren't detectable until the player posseses the correct tier of ore detector.
- Power generators have various tiers and engineering decisions are constrained by a balance pass to the power draw of most blocks. 
- PvE is supported by adding resources only found in pirate 'loot' inventories called caches.
- Grinding ships is heavily nerfed, both by hand and via large grinder pits until late game
