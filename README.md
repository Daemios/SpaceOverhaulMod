# SpaceOverhaulMod
Space Engineers overhaul that makes progression between stellar bodies and the gathering of materials the main focus of the game. 

Core concepts and goals:
- Most tech blocks and tools have several tiers available to add additional functionality, as well as speed/power/etc.
- Various tedious mining operators can be abstracted in the mid and late-game with expensive but passive resource generating blocks.
- Power generators have various tiers and form factors for all stages of the game.
- Engineering decisions are constrained by a balance pass to the power draw of most blocks. 
- PvE is supported by adding resources only found in pirate 'loot' inventories called caches
- Space should feel dangerous and until a player is confident in their ship, the focus is on getting to your destination without dying
- Grinding ships is heavily nerfed, both by hand and via large grinder pits until late game
