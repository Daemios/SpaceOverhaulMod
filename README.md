# SpaceOverhaulMod
Space Engineers overhaul that makes progression between stellar bodies and the gathering of materials the main focus of the game. 

Core concepts and goals:
- Most tech blocks and tools have several tiers available to add additional functionality, as well as speed/power/etc.
- Various tedious mining operators can be abstracted in the mid and late-game with expensive but passive resource generating blocks.
- Power generators have various tiers and form factors for all stages of the game.
- Engineering decisions are constrained by a balance pass to the power draw of most blocks. 
- PvE is supported by adding resources only found in pirate 'loot' inventories called caches
- Space should feel dangerous and until a player is confident in their ship, the focus is on getting to your destination without dying
- Grinding ships is heavily nerfed, both by hand and via large grinder pits until late game

## Planetary Details
### Earth
Homeworld. Extremely light pirate activity. 

#### Notable Details
- Respawn and refining services are available at spawn. 
- Ammo and guns are available for barter from spawn.
- Hostile factions present on-world only spawn with small grid ships that can be taken down with handheld guns or a modestly-armed ground vehicles

#### Available Minerals
Gravel - Found in all non-ore voxels.
Iron - Found in surface (small) and shallow (large, T1 req.) deposits
Graphene - Refinable. Refined from gravel or found on pirate cargo shuttles.
Aerogel - Loot only. Available from pirate caches found on armed pirate ships
Neodymium - Refinable. Found in shallow (large) deposits and rarely in small surface deposits
Lithium - Refinable. Found in shallow (small, T1 req.) deposits and refined in small quantities via lithium refinery
Bioplastics - Generated. Only available from bioplastic refineries, the pinnacle production tech for this planet.
??? - Only available upon return with t2 ore detector
??? - Only available upon return with t2 ore detector

#### Available Tech and Materials
- Steel plate (Iron Ore + Graphene) The foundational material
- Light armor (Steel) - To build your first vehicle with
- Some sort of open-air seat (Steel) 
- T1 Small Grid Storage (Steel) - Store your first mining hauls using this
- Hydrogen engine (Steel) - First means of power generation by burning hydrogen pellets. Other tiers available with more resources.
- Wheels (Steel + Neodynium) - First means of powered transportation
- Bioplastic Foundry (Aerogel) - Small and large grid mobile resource generation. Bioplastic is used heavily in early midgame, production should be prioritized
- T1 Ore Detector (Neodynium)
- Hydrogen Thruster (Bioplastics)
