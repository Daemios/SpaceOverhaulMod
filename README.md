# Space Overhaul Mod
Space Engineers overhaul that makes progression between stellar bodies and the gathering of materials the main focus of the game. 

Core concepts and goals:
- Most tech blocks and tools have several tiers available to add additional functionality, as well as changes speed/power draw/etc.
- Various tedious mining operations can be automated with expensive but passive resource generating blocks available for static grids..
- Automated mining are processed independantly of loaded grids and does not require the grid to be loaded to increment the 'haul' of resources.
- Surface ores and bulk processing/generation are the main sources of materials until ore detectors are unlocked.
- Power generators have various tiers and engineering decisions are constrained by a balance pass to the power draw of most blocks. 
- PvE is supported by adding resources only found in pirate 'loot' inventories called caches.
- Higher grinder levels unlock additional materials that are returned. Grinding without the requisite grinder for a material deletes the item and returns it as scrap.
- Distances between planets and moons have been increased.
- Jumpgate blocks allow players to build, aim, and utilize FTL travel by building up infrastructure dedicated to traversing space.
- SOM introduces different tiers of warp drives for late- and endgame vessels (low tier options are called 'Tug Drives' and have to be assigned to a specific jump anchor)
- Aspirationally, I would like to allow players to set up cargo routes by 'recording' the time it takes them to fly between two grids and docking.
- Cargo routes would transfer the recorded amount of cargo every N minutes, where N is the time it took to fly the route.
- Higher tier jumpgates would allow for more cargo to be moved

# Location Details
Each location in the solar system provides unique resources and environmental conditions.

## Space
Hotspot for pirate activity and advanced factions-- inhospitable until late game.
#### Notable features 
- Extremely rare asteroids containing precious metals used in Ion Thrusters construction
- T1 Ion thrusters are available in early-midgame, but given the nature of the threats in space it is unlikely that large scale mining operations are feasible.

## Earth
Homeworld. Extremely light pirate activity. Starting location.

#### Notable features 
- Earth's atmosphere, gravity, and environment are extremely condusive to most production facilities

## Moon
First point of interest after leaving Earth.
### Notable features 
- Low-G environment useful to produce advanced materials required for further exploration
- T1 iron miner available for use on earth at end of Moon progression

## Mars
### Notable features
- Several low-tier dense ore deposits are available for automining.
- Tier 1 jumpgate available at end of Mars/Europa tree

## Europa
### Notable features 
- Tier 1 jumpgate available at end of Mars/Europa tree
